This article speaks on the logic and methods behind design, and shows how they can be applied to programming. "Design Thinking" is defined as,

"solving complex problems creatively in an user-centric way"

This process is broken up into 5 steps: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Although these steps are self-explanatory, one important thing to note is that they are all user-centric; one should approach them with an open mind. In fact, the author explains that the entire process begins with empathy. This "Empathize" step of the process defines empathy as putting aside any preconceived notions about a problem, and being open to understanding any such problems that might exist. The reason this idea of design thinking can be applied so well to software development is because it values important principles in the software development process: an iterative approach, an actionable problem statement, and a meaningful solution.
